; This is the code for a simple set of widget buttons that perform different
; actions when they are selected, hence the name 'action buttons'.

; A button's VALUE is equal to the label on the face of the button.
; In this example, the labels on the buttons are text strings, but
; buttons can have bitmapped images as labels instead.  For an example
; of creating a bitmapped button, see the file WBITMAP.PRO.


 
PRO wbuttons_event, event
; This procedure is the event handler for a simple set of 'action' buttons.

; When a widget is touched, put its User Value into 'eventval':

WIDGET_CONTROL, event.id, GET_UVALUE = eventval

; This CASE statement branches based upon the value of 'eventval:

CASE eventval OF
	'GREET'	: PRINT, 'Hello World!'			;The 'Print a Greeting' button
							;has been selected, so print
							;a message in the IDL window.

	'PRINT'	: PRINT, 'IDL Widgets are Cool.'	;The 'Print a Message' button
							;has been selected, so print
							;a message in the IDL window.

	'DONE'	: WIDGET_CONTROL, event.top, /DESTROY	;The 'Done' button has been
							;selected, so destroy the widget.
ENDCASE
END
