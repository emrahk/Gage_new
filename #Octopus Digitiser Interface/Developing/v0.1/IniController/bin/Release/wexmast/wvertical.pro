; This is the code for a simple vertical slider.  Moving the slider in
; this example causes the slider's new value to be printed in the IDL
; window.
;
; Sliders come in two varieties, horizontal (the default) and
; vertical.  For an example of a horizontal slider, see the routine
; WSLIDER.PRO.

; Sliders are used to select integer values from
; a well-bounded range.  For example, a slider is a good widget
; to use for allowing users to select a color from an 8-bit palette.
; For an example of just such an application, see the routine
; WORLDROT.PRO available from the 'Simple Widget Examples' widget
; by selecting 'World Rotation Tool'.



PRO wvertical_event, event
; This is the event handler for a basic vertical slider.

; Use WIDGET_CONTROL to get the user value of any widget touched and put
; that value into 'eventval':

WIDGET_CONTROL, event.id, GET_UVALUE = eventval

; The movement of sliders is easily handled with a CASE statement.
; When the slider is moved, the value of 'eventval' becomes 'SLIDE':

CASE eventval OF
	'SLIDE':BEGIN
		
		; Get the current value of the slider and put it in the
		; variable 's':
		WIDGET_CONTROL, event.id, GET_VALUE = s
		
		; Print the slider value to the IDL window:
		PRINT, s
		END
ENDCASE
END



PRO wvertical, GROUP = GROUP

; This is the procedure that creates a single slider.

; A top-level base widget with the title "Vertical Slider Example" will
; hold the slider:

base = WIDGET_BASE(TITLE = 'Vertical Slider Example', /COLUMN)

; Often, a slider's minimum and maximum values are defined by an expression:

minvalue = 0
maxvalue = 100

; A widget called 'slider' is created. It has the title 'Slider Widget', 
; a frame around it, and a User Value of 'SLIDE':

slider = WIDGET_SLIDER (base, $
			MINIMUM = minvalue, $		;The minimum value.
			MAXIMUM = maxvalue, $		;The maximum value.
		        TITLE = 'Slider Widget', $	;The slider title.
			/FRAME, $			;Put a frame around the slider.
		  	UVALUE = 'SLIDE',$		;Set the User Value to 'SLIDE'.
			/VERTICAL, $			;Make the slider vertical.
			XSIZE = 300) 

; Realize the widgets:
WIDGET_CONTROL, base, /REALIZE

; Hand off control of the widget to the XMANAGER:
XMANAGER, "wvertical", base, GROUP_LEADER = GROUP, /NO_BLOCK
