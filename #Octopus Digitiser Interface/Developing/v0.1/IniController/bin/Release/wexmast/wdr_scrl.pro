; This is the code for a DRAW widget with scroll bars.  It 
; displays a portion of an image of a "DIST" in the drawing
; window.  It also allows the user to erase the
; draw widget and to redraw the image.  If the mouse button
; is pressed while the cursor is moved over the displayed
; image, the X and Y positions of the cursor are printed in
; the IDL window.

; For an example of a draw widget without scroll bars, 
; see the procedure WDRAW.PRO.
