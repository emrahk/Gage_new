; This is the code for a simple DRAW widget.  It displays
; an image of a "DIST" and allows the user to erase the
; draw widget and to redraw the image.  If the mouse button
; is pressed while the cursor is moved over the displayed 
; image, the X and Y positions of the cursor are printed in
; the IDL window.

; Draw widgets are very similar to IDL graphics windows.
 
; For an example of a draw widget with scroll bars, 
; see the procedure WDR_SCRL.PRO.

PRO wdraw_event, event
; This is the event handler for a simple draw widget.

; The COMMON block is used because the event handler usually needs
; the window number and the size of the draw widget:

COMMON wdrawblock, win_num, orig_image, x_im_sz, y_im_sz

; When a widget is manipulated, put its User Value into the variable 'eventval':

WIDGET_CONTROL, event.id, GET_UVALUE = eventval

; Perform actions based on the User Value of the event:
CASE eventval OF
   'DRAW_WIN_EVENT': BEGIN
			; The help statement is useful for
			; debugging the event handler.  Try uncommenting
			; it to see the full structure returned by a 
			; draw window event.  Note the 'PRESS' and
			; 'RELEASE' fields.
			; HELP, /STRUCT, event

			; Only deal with the 'press' event,
			; disregard the 'release' event
			IF event.press EQ 1 THEN BEGIN
				; Print the device coordinates of the cursor
				PRINT, 'X = ', event.x
				PRINT, 'Y = ', event.y
			ENDIF
		     END

   'ERASE': BEGIN
		swin = !D.WINDOW        ; Save previous window
		; Set the window number - important for multiple windows
		WSET, win_num                
                ERASE                   ; Erase the image
		WSET, swin              ; Restore previous window
             END

		WSET, swin              ; Restore previous window
